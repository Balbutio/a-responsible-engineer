### Fasten your seatbelts for climate and politics in 2025

This last week has been a roller-coaster. We now begin to process Donald Trump's return to power, and the implications this has on climate change. No doubt his re-election will reverberate around COP29 over the next two weeks - he is expected to once again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement, and abandon commitments to reduce emissions inline with 2030 targets.

Whilst I am still holding onto the guard rail pretty tightly, I have also been given reason to take a deep breath and look towards the future with hope. Back at the Green IO 2024 conference in London, Ishmael Burdeau and James Martin both highlighted the success of the [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/world/) movement, and it's value in helping us both objectively understand the science behind climate change, and reaffirm our commitments to tackling it. So in a bid to refresh my outlook, amongst the political turbulence, I took part in an online public workshop.

Climate Fresk is an interactive card game built around the IPCC reports, where you work with others to identify the scientific causes, consequences and links between elements of climate change. I was joined by participants and facilitators from Germany, France, Qatar, Morocco, Canada, the U.K. and Iran. It's quite something to reflect that despite our incredible digital connectedness, there are not many causes which brings people from so many different cultures together. The climate emergency bucks this trend, we all share the same planet, and the topic unifies us all.

As a group, we examined the systemic nature of our climate emergency with renewed purpose. We also reflected on the duality between our understanding of climate's urgency and importance, and how we are often easily overwhelmed and de-sensitised towards it. It was a really illuminating session, and it has certainly got me thinking about climate with more purpose and talking more about it with friends and family.

We face big societal challenges ahead, but election results don't change what is required of us. Our goal today is the same as it was last month, and it's the same as it will be in 2029. Perhaps these results can even be the catalyst for us to make some positive changes to our lifestyles and our work. That is up to us.

On that note, the community of responsible technologists working on digital sustainability is one of the most open, helpful and inspiring groups around. If you're a practitioner looking to progress your own journey in digital sustainability, I've put together a launchpad for - in the form of a github repo which might be a helpful springboard to get involved: https://github.com/Balbutio/digital-sustainability-handbook.
