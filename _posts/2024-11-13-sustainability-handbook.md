### Fasten your seatbelts for climate and politics in 2025

This last week has been a roller-coaster, and whilst I am still holding onto the guard rail pretty tightly, I have been given reason to take a deep breath and look towards the future of tackling climate change with hope. Back at the Green IO 2024 conference in London, Ishmael Burdeau and James Martin both highlighted the success of the [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/world/) movement, and it's value in helping us objectively understand the science behind climate change. There seems to be a duality around the the climate emergency - we understand it's importance, but we easily get overwhelmed and de-sensitised towards it. So in a bid to refresh my outlook, amongst all the politics and news of last week, I took part in an online public workshop.

Climate Fresk is an interactive card game built around the IPCC reports, where you work with others to identify the scientific causes, consequences and links between elements of climate change. I was joined by participants and facilitators from Germany, France, Qatar, Morocco, Canada, the U.K. and Iran. It's quite something to reflect that despite our incredible digital connectedness, there are not many causes which brings people from so many different cultures together. The climate emergency bucks this trend, we all share the same planet, and the topic unifies us all.

I'm delighted to report that Climate Fresk is a great tool to re-examine the systemic nature of our climate emergency with purpose, and reflect on the societal challenges we face ahead. Doing so with others around the world is illuminating.
