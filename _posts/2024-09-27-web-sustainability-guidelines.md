title:  "Green IO London 2024 / Web Sustainability Guidelines: Getting Started"
---

## Community driven change

The second Green IO* London conference took place last week on September 19th, 2024. Principally organised by Gaël Duez, the event (and others like it) represents a growing movement of responsible technologists that are aware of the increasing environmental impact of IT and are committed to reducing it. In one of many exciting talks at the conference, Alexander Dawson of the Sustainable Web Design Community Group discussed the [Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) 1.0](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) – a publicly available specification which is seeking to become an official W3C standard and may one day hold a similar influence to the WCAG.

_* You should definitely check out the [Green IO podcast and newsletter](https://podcasts.castplus.fm/greenio) for interesting interviews and news – you won’t regret it._

Before jumping headfirst into the specification, Alexander advised checking out the [introduction page](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/intro.html) – this outlines the manifesto behind the specification and highlights the core principle of putting Planet, People and Prosperity first.
When it is time to examine the specification in more detail, try not to be put off by its size. Perhaps digest it in chunks - starting with sections that reach out to you. You might even find that some guidelines overlap with your current work.

## Incorporating sustainability into our work

The specification itself outlines a wide range of principles that can be incorporated into User-Experience design, Web development, Hosting and Infrastructure, Business Strategy and Product Management. Importantly, the specification is specific enough to be useful without being overly prescriptive. Each principle has an impact and effort score as well as various success criteria and supporting material.

In addition, the specification outlines other interlinked positive benefits relating to each principle. For example; outlining where Performance, Security and Accessibility is improved by taking a sustainable approach. Finally, the specification also outlines how each principal maps to the GRI topic standards of materials, energy, water and emissions.

If you’re beginning your journey to incorporate sustainability (and the WSG guidelines) into your work, I would suggest starting small, and consciously making some sustainable decisions in your next project.

Whilst It’s obviously most impactful to start identifying and tackling the biggest contributor of CO2e - you might find yourself wrapped up in trying to accurately calculate emissions relating to user-devices, networking, data-centres, device production and disposal, etc… or caught up in the headache of attributional vs consequential accounting. This stuff is complicated - and even the best minds of this field are continuing to develop their opinions on how we can best tackle sustainability in IT. For example, Ismael Velasco recently [highlighted some substantive flaws/assumptions in Carbon Aware computing](https://hackernoon.com/carbon-aware-computing-next-green-breakthrough-or-new-greenwashing).

A famous quote by the French writer Voltaire "The best is the enemy of the good" comes to mind on this topic, and certainly, if we are to tackle the global climate crisis and begin better embedding sustainability in IT - the first step is moving to wider action. Chris Adams summed this up well in his talk on "[Consensus as a Climate Lever](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/events/green-io-conf-london/)" - noting that rough consensus and iterating in the open is important for progression in this space, and that, “If our work is complementary we will have more sway”.

The more that we collectively consider sustainability, the more it can become embedded in our industry and everyday practice.

## Calling all Presidents and Directors

Another aspect of the WSG that stands out is its calling across the landscape of IT professionals. Business Strategy and Product Management are sometimes overlooked in sustainable IT strategies, but when you think about it – these functions often shape our digital requirements as well as our digital products and services. It is therefore essential that our sustainability strategy is holistic and involves those in leadership positions. Section 3.5 of the WSG offers some building blocks for this, highlighting many useful recommendations in this area.

On the topic of influence – in her talk on sustainability at Salesforce, Tereze Gaile disclosed that several high-profile customers had recently enquired about Salesforce’s actions towards sustainability and reduction of climate impact. She reported that this prompted much internal work and has led to a fast-tracked sustainability strategy. A key takeaway for those purchasing or renewing software is to ask about the sustainability strategy of our vendors as part of the procurement process – such efforts can be a significant catalyst for digital sustainability.

A culture that embraces digital sustainability can significantly set organisations or products apart.

## Where do we go from here?

Let’s be the change we want to see. Start simple and start now. Get sponsorship from your leaders, start talking to peers about sustainability and mindfully incorporate it into your work. Finally, the wider community of responsible technologists are some of the most open, helpful** and inspiring, so get involved and look out for sustainability events near you.
